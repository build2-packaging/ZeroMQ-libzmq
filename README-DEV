# Development Notes

The header file `libzmq/src/platform.hpp` in the `libzmq` package is actually not symlinked but was copied and edited to handle platform specific symbols in build2 appropriately.

In upstream the `platform.hpp` is generated by the CMake build system based on a input template. The original template file contains many `cmakedefine` entries which cannot be handled by build2. For the build2 package these cmakedefines were removed and instead build2 passes the symbols on the command line to the compiler (note that the header file is private).

If the upstream version is updated, this file has to be revised and adjusted, if needed by the new version.
